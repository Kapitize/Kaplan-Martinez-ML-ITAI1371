This was a lab to review modules learned and learning in the future during our midterm.
We had a professor leave in the middle of the semester and was assigned a new professor.
Due to not fully learning the correct masterial or learning the "Right way", this was assigned from our new professor giving us a recap of our mid semester and giving us a new learning curve.
