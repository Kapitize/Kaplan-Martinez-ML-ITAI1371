This was a lab to review modules learned and learning in the future during our midterm.
We had a professor leave in the middle of the semester and was assigned a new professor.
Due to not fully learning the correct masterial or learning the "Right way", this was assigned from our new professor giving us a recap of our mid semester and providing us with a new learning curve.

  Class objectives:  
•Apply the end-to-end ML workflow to a real dataset.  
•Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover data stories.  
•Implement data preparation techniques like handling missing values and encoding.  
•Train, evaluate, and compare multiple classification models.  
•Interpret advanced evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, ROC/AUC).  
•Understand the concepts of overfitting, underfitting, and ensemble methods.  
•Demonstrate understanding by answering reflective questions directly within the notebook.
