Here is a midterm given by our new professor after we reviewed our course recap and have recieved the new necessary tools for the semester.
This was our first real use of coding or an assignment related to ML that gave a helpful perspective of what was expected to know in the future.  

  Our Objectives:  
•Apply the complete ML workflow in a practical, project-based scenario.  
•Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to form hypotheses and discover patterns.  
•Implement and justify data preparation and feature engineering choices.  
•Train, evaluate, and compare multiple classification models.  
•Interpret evaluation metrics to understand model performance and its limitations.  
•Develop critical thinking skills by answering reflective questions about your specific results.  

Choices:  
I selected the titanic dataset to use for the base of this Midterm.  
In doing so, created a Couple Features for the system to train off of.  
The over all objective was to train a module that could accuratly predict the survival and non-survived rate.  
While using those impleminted features, sourcing out unnecesary features to use for the module.  
Using visual graphs to help us visualize what type of adjustments were necessary as well.
