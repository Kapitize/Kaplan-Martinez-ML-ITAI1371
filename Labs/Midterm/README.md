Here is a midterm given by our new professor after we reviewed our course recap and have recieved the new necessary tools for the semester.
This was our first real use of coding or an assignment related to ML that gave a helpful perspective of what was expected to know in the future.  

  Our Objectives:  
•Apply the complete ML workflow in a practical, project-based scenario.  
•Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to form hypotheses and discover patterns.  
•Implement and justify data preparation and feature engineering choices.  
•Train, evaluate, and compare multiple classification models.  
•Interpret evaluation metrics to understand model performance and its limitations.  
•Develop critical thinking skills by answering reflective questions about your specific results.
