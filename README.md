Intro to ML (ITAI 1371)

At the time of this writing, I am a freshman in college, currently attending HCC. 
With choosing the AI course, Intro to machine learning was a mandatory course, and I am grateful to have had the education as it shows what was expected from me to know about the AI basics. 

Here are a couple assignments and labs that have been completed:  
- Midsemester recap(L10)  
- Midterm
- Final (Not Due Yet)
